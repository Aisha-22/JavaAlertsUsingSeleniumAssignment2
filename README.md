**Challenges
When working with WebApps sometimes you see window Alerts, or if you try type something you get a Popup.

The popup that you see is not html based, it's not tied up to the web.

If it's not html you will not be able to get any properties, it is Java scripts Alerts and Selenium by default cannot handle this.
